# HTML-and-CSS-Projects

This repository contains all of the files and projects I have been working on since beginning the HTML and CSS course.

I have worked on basic HTML websites and progressed to adding CSS and javascript to create more complex pages.

I have used various tools to complete my projects including VSCODE, Notepad ++, and Bootstrap.

All of this has culminated in the creation of my own fully functional portfolio website.
